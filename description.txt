Description

This project combines classical computer vision lane detection with a custom-trained YOLOv8n 
object detector. The system processes real road images from the nuScenes dataset and produces 
an annotated driving video showing lane boundaries, detected vehicles, pedestrians, traffic 
lights, and other road objects. The goal of the project is to demonstrate an integrated 
perception pipeline for autonomous driving use cases.
