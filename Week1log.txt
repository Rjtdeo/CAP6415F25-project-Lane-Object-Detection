Week 1 Log

This week I finalized my project idea: combining lane detection with object detection using YOLOv8. 
I reviewed nuScenes camera data and confirmed that the dataset includes multiple camera views suitable 
for building a realistic driving pipeline.

Key tasks completed:
- Set up project repository and base folder structure.
- Installed required libraries: Ultralytics YOLOv8, PyTorch, NumPy, OpenCV.
- Explored nuScenes mini dataset and verified image formats.
- Wrote initial test scripts to load and display camera frames.
- Planned the overall workflow: data preparation → model training → inference → final video.
