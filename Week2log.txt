Week 2 Log

This week focused on building the dataset for YOLO training. I tested several auto-labeling 
approaches and finalized the pipeline using YOLOv8x for initial annotations.

Key tasks completed:
- Wrote a script to auto-label images using YOLOv8x.
- Split data into train/val folders (80/20).
- Generated YOLO-formatted TXT label files.
- Created dataset.yaml describing paths and class names.
- Confirmed dataset quality by visually inspecting sample annotations.
