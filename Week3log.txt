Week 3 Log

I trained the custom YOLOv8n model this week. The goal was to create a lightweight detector 
capable of real-time inference with road camera footage.

Key tasks completed:
- Ran training for 40 epochs using the prepared dataset.
- Monitored loss curves and ensured training converged normally.
- Verified that the best.pt file was saved correctly.
- Documented class distribution and training parameters.
- Began testing inference on individual frames.
